This code develops a binary imagine classifier for the pneumonia using the chset xray data from: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 
The model is based on transfer learning. As base model VGG19 was used and all the layers are re-trained again for the best results. 

Final model gives:
Recall of the model is 0.98
Precision of the model is 0.93
